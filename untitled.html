	Berserk is a seinen (dark, adult themes like death and war) fantasy series written and illustrated by the incomparable Kentaro Miura.
	The manga is famous for artwork depicting both terror and beauty with incredible detail.
	The series takes place in Midland, the continent seems to be based off medieval Europe (with demons).
	We are introduced to a troubled young mercenary named Guts. Guts is not a people person and has no choice to live by his sword Dragon Slayer. He has no family or friends.
	Despite his sketchy past, things seem to get better for Guts when he joins The Band of the Hawk (well regarded as heroes for hire instead of your average sellsword).  In time he rises up to second in command and enjoys comfort for the first time in his life: he eats every day, there is a safe place for him to sleep at night, he has a stable job and even friends. But everything is not as it seemsâ€¦
